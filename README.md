# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
 npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Salami.js --network localhost

const contractAddress = "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3";
0xe7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512

```
